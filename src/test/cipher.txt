Cipher Tests

for all valid characters, compare Cipher.decipherChar(testChar) to expected char
    - ex.: Cipher.decipherChar('b') == 'a'

for a few invalid characters, such as punctuation, compare Cipher.decipherChar(testChar) to the tested Char
    - ex.: Cipher.decipherChar('.') == '.'

Test small strings
    - ex.: Cipher.decipherChar("abc ABC xyz XYZ. 1234!") == "0ab zAB wxy WXY. Z123!"
Test the provided strings in data/carnivore.cip and data/cointelpro.cip
    - ex.: "Dbsojwpsf, mbufs sfobnfe EDT2aaa, xbt b tztufn jnqmfnfoufe cz uif Gfefsbm Cvsfbv pg Jowftujhbujpo (GCJ) uibu xbt

            "Carnivore, later renamed DCS1000, was a system implemented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that was
            designed to monitor email and electronic communications. It used a customizable packet sniffer that could monitor all
            of a target user's Internet traffic. Carnivore was implemented in October 1997. By 2005 it had been replaced with
            improved commercial software."
