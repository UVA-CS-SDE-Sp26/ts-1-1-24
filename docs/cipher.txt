A cipher class/method will return a deciphered string from a given ciphered string
The cipher key is stored in a file called key.txt in the ciphers folder
The cipher file matches ciphered letters with deciphered letters
The first line is the deciphered letter, the second line is the cipher match
When the cipher is accessed, it must be validated
All methods will be static

public class Cipher
    static cipherFileLocation = "../../../ciphers/key.txt"

    static cipherFile = open file

    public static char deciperChar(char cipheredChar)
        cipheredCharInFile = read file, return index of cipheredChar from second line if found, else -1
        if cipheredCharInFile > -1
            decipheredCharInFile = read file, return char on second line using cipheredCharInFile
            return decipheredCharInFile
        else
            return cipheredChar

    public static String decipherText(String cipheredText)
        String decipheredText = empty string
        foreach (char cipheredChar in cipheredText)
            decipheredChar = decipherChar(cipheredChar)
            decipheredText += decipheredChar
        return decipheredText
