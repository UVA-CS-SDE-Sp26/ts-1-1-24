A cipher class/method will return a deciphered string from a given ciphered string
The cipher key is stored in a file called key.txt in the ciphers folder
The cipher file matches ciphered letters with deciphered letters
The first line is the deciphered letter, the second line is the cipher match
When the cipher is accessed, it must be validated
All methods will be static

Cipher Tests

check that validateCipher looks for all the right characters
    ex.: validateCipher("abc") == false
         validateCipher("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890")  == true

check that ciphered/deciphered characters are correct
    - ex.: getDecipheredCharacters() == "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890"

for all valid characters, compare Cipher.decipherChar(testChar) to expected char
    - ex.: Cipher.decipherChar('b') == 'a'

for a few invalid characters, such as punctuation, compare Cipher.decipherChar(testChar) to the tested Char
    - ex.: Cipher.decipherChar('.') == '.'

Test small strings
    - ex.: Cipher.decipherChar("abc ABC xyz XYZ. 1234!") == "0ab zAB wxy WXY. Z123!"
Test the provided strings in data/carnivore.cip and data/cointelpro.cip
    - ex.: "Dbsojwpsf, mbufs sfobnfe EDT2aaa, xbt b tztufn jnqmfnfoufe cz uif Gfefsbm Cvsfbv pg Jowftujhbujpo (GCJ) uibu xbt

            "Carnivore, later renamed DCS1000, was a system implemented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that was
            designed to monitor email and electronic communications. It used a customizable packet sniffer that could monitor all
            of a target user's Internet traffic. Carnivore was implemented in October 1997. By 2005 it had been replaced with
            improved commercial software."
