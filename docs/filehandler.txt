This part of the program is responsible for managing file access for the TopSecret Assignment.
It will read in data files from a folder named data. When a request is made for a file in the
directory, the program will return the file content.

Pseudocode
Method getAvailableFiles
    Open the "data" folder in directory

    If directory does not exist
        Throw an error

    Get items inside directory
    Filter to include only regular files (use stream process from lecture)
    Convert each file to its filename
    Sort filenames in alphabetical order
    Return filenames

Function readFile(filename)
    Create the file path by combining "data" directory and filename

    If file does not exist
        Throw an error

    Read entire file as text
    Return file contents as a string


Tests
1. list available files and return them
2. read a file and return its content
3. check for missing files
4. check if directory exists
