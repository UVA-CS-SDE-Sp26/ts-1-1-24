Objectives
My role for Homework 2 - Top Secret is to connect the command line to the file handler. I will be requesting file contents and returning it into
readable text for the user. I will create unit test cases to ensure that the program works properly for different situations.

Accomplish:
- reading files
- returning file contents

Pseudocode
public static ArrayList<String> listFiles() {
    // Access the list of files from Team Member B
    files = FileHandler.readFile(fileName);

    // Check if files is empty
    if files is empty
        print "There are no files available"
        return available file types

    // Displaying each file with its corresponding file number
    for every i element in files
        print (i + 1) + " " + files[i]
}

public static ArrayList<String> returnFilesContent(fileNumber, key) {
    // Access the list of files from Team Member B
    files = FileHandler.listFiles();

    // Check if the file number for the file is valid (can't be less than 1 or greater than the file size)
    if fileNumber < 0 or fileNumber > files.size()
        print "The file number is invalid"
        return fileList()

    // Match the file number to it's corresponding file name from the list
    fileName = files[fileNumber - 1]

    // Asking Team Member B for the content in the file
    content = FileHandler.readFile(fileName);

    // Asking Team Member D for the cipher key
    if the key exists
        content = Cipher.decipher(content, key)
    else
        content = Cipher.decipherDefaultKey(content)

    return content

    // Possible errors
    if files is empty
        print "The file being accessed is empty"
        fileList()
    else
        print "Error when accessing files"
}

Tests
For listFiles()
- when the file exists, it prints out the correct list (with the valid file number)
- when the file does not exist, it prints "There are no files available" then returns the available list of files (along with the file number)
-

For returnFilesContent()
    Valid file numbers:
        - when the file has a valid file number and is using the default key
        - when the file has a valid file number and is using a custom key
    Invalid file numbers:
        - when the file number is less than 1 (an invalid file number)
        - when the file number is greater than the size (an invalid file number)
        - when the file number is not a valid number (random characters, etc.)
