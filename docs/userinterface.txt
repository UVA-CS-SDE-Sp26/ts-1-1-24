The command line interface is what is used by the user to run the program.
It takes user arguments of a file selection and a key selection. With no key selection,

ProgramController (Helen/Role C).

Tests:
1. Test that providing 0 arguments works properly.
2. Test that providing a valid file number works properly (no key).
3. Test that providing a valid file and key is sent to program control properly.
4. Test that too many arguments are handled properly.
5. Test that invalid arguments are handled properly.

User Interface Options:
The program is run from the class TopSecret using the command java topsecret.
Running java topsecret will list the numbered files available to display.

There is the option to run java topsecret with an argument that is a two digit

previous number. It is the choice of a custom alternate key to decipher a file.

Ex: java top secret __ ______...
